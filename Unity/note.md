## How run the specs

For now wiht a single command on cli

```bash
gcc test_my_test_file.c ../../Unity/unity.c
```

> This assumes that the tests will be in a folder called `unity` within the challenge day folder.

## The library used is `Unity`

# I really need to do a Makefile to automate this routine

** In progress...
    - Export the source code of each challenge to a header file then import on tests.
