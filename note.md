        - valgrind
          - i need read more about
          - to find memory leaks
            - valgrind -s --leak-check=yes ./executable
          - i can use callgrind to profile the code
            - valgrind --tool=callgrind ./executable
            - callgrind_annotate callgrind.out
        - part II
          - need fix memory leaks (OK!)
          - need simplify the code (OK!)

        - (Î£) 0.05ms to run. Blazingly fast!
        - part 2 is really easy with functions as modules

# Day 7
    - Better modules
    - Header files on include/
        - need add `compile_flags.txt` file on folder to teel to LSP where find the header files. See: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html
    - Compiler flags
        - -I to include directories to compiler search path (header files)
            - one to each dir (-I include -I ../Unity)
